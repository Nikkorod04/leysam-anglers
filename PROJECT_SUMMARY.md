## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Setup (Development)
- Test mode for Firestore (open read/write)
- Test mode for Storage (open read/write)
- Email/password authentication only

### Production Recommendations
- Implement proper Firestore security rules (provided in SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- Implement Storage security rules with size limits
- Add rate limiting
- Implement user roles (admin, moderator, user)
- Add content moderation
- Enable Firebase App Check

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js v16+
2. Expo CLI
3. Expo Go app on mobile device
4. Firebase account

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Configure Firebase
# Edit: src/services/firebase.ts

# Start development server
npm start

# Scan QR code with Expo Go
```

See **SETUP_GUIDE.md** for detailed instructions.

## 📱 Screen Flow

```
Auth Flow:
Login → Signup → [Authentication]

Main Flow:
[Authenticated] →
├── Map Tab
│   ├── View spots
│   └── Add Spot → [Spot Added] → Map

## 📝 Important Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `App.tsx` | Root component, app initialization |
| `app.json` | Expo configuration |
| `src/services/firebase.ts` | **Must configure with your Firebase credentials** |
| `src/constants/theme.ts` | Color scheme and styling constants |
| `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` | Authentication state management |
| `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` | App navigation structure |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Firebase Configuration Required:**
   - You MUST update `src/services/firebase.ts` with your own Firebase credentials
   - See FIREBASE_CONFIG.md for detailed instructions

2. **Permissions:**
   - Location permission required for adding spots
   - Camera/photo library permission required for images

3. **Testing:**
   - Test on physical devices (not simulators) for best results
   - Maps work better on real devices with GPS

4. **Network:**
   - Requires internet connection for Firebase
   - Real-time updates may have slight delay
